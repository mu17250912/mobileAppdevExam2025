APP_NAME:
 E-Recruitment App

A modern, user-friendly Flutter application for digital recruitment, connecting job seekers and employers with real-time updates and secure authentication. Built with Firebase for robust backend support.



 Problem Statement

Traditional recruitment processes are often slow, inefficient, and lack transparency. Job seekers struggle to find relevant opportunities, while companies face challenges in reaching qualified candidates and managing applications. This app solves these problems by:
- Digitizing the recruitment process for faster, more efficient hiring.
- Ensuring transparency for both job seekers and employers.
- Providing real-time notifications and status management.

Business Model:
- Any company wishing to post jobs and hire workers must pay a fee to the app owner.
- Workers who secure jobs through the platform are required to pay 5% of their monthly salary as a service fee.

## Monetization Strategy

This app uses a dual-sided monetization approach to ensure sustainability and reward the value it provides to both employers and job seekers:

 1. Employer/Company Fees
- **Job Posting Fee:**
  Any company wishing to post job openings and hire workers through the platform must pay a fee to the app owner. This fee grants them access to a pool of qualified candidates and the ability to manage applications efficiently.

 2. Worker/Job Seeker Commission
- **Placement Commission:**
  Workers who secure jobs through the platform are required to pay 5% of their monthly salary as a service fee. This commission is only applicable once the worker is successfully placed in a job, ensuring the platform is rewarded for successful matches.

### 3. Optional Concierge Service
- **Premium Job Search Assistance:**
  For users who do not have time to manage the job search process themselves, the platform offers a premium service:
  - For a one-time fee of **20,000 RWF**, users can send their documents to the companyâ€™s email, and the team will handle the job search and application process on their behalf, increasing their chances of landing a dream job.

This strategy ensures the platform remains free to browse and apply for jobs, while generating revenue from companies seeking talent and from successful job placements.
