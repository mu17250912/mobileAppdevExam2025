## 💸 Monetization

BookSwap generates revenue through two core mechanisms:

### 1. Commission on Book Sales

- **10% commission** is deducted from every book sale. The remaining 90% is credited to the user who listed the book.
- All commission and payout transactions are recorded in Firestore and visible in the admin dashboard.

### 2. Live MTN MoMo Payments

- All book purchases are processed using a live integration with the MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) API
- Buyers enter their MoMo-enabled phone number and receive a real-time payment prompt.
- Payment status is polled and updated in real time.

> 2. You will receive a popup prompt on your phone to approve the payment.
