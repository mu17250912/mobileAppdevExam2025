Finding reliable work or skilled workers is a challenge for many people. KaziLink solves this by providing a trusted, easy-to-use platform for job seekers and employers to connect, communicate, and transact securely.

## Target Audience

- Employers and clients looking to hire for short- or long-term work

## Market Fit & Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
- **Existing solutions:** Upwork, Fiverr, local job boards
- **KaziLink USP:** Localized, mobile-first, real-time chat, premium profile promotion, and a simple, accessible interface for emerging markets.

## How KaziLink Solves the Problem
- Fast onboarding and role selection (worker/client)
- Secure authentication and user profiles
- Job posting, search, and application with filtering and sorting
- Real-time chat and notifications
- Premium upgrades for increased visibility and benefits

## Monetization Strategy
- **Freemium Model:** Free users see ads and have limited job applications. Premium users get unlimited applications, profile promotion, no ads, and priority support.
- **Ad Integration:** Google AdMob banners are shown to free users only.
- **Premium Upgrade:** Users can upgrade via a simulated Flutterwave payment (demo flow).

**Justification:**
- Freemium and ads are proven models for job platforms in emerging markets.
- Premium features provide real value and incentive to upgrade.

## Analytics & Tracking
- **Planned:** Firebase Analytics for tracking user signups, job postings, premium upgrades, and ad impressions.
- **How:** Events will be logged for key actions (login, job apply, upgrade, etc.) to inform future improvements and monetization.
