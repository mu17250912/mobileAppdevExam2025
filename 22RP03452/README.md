Problem the App Solves

In many schools, communication between parents and teachers is inconsistent, relying on outdated methods like printed notes or sporadic meetings. This limits parental involvement and awareness of student progress.

SchoolMessenger solves this problem by:
- Enabling real-time, two-way communication between parents and teachers
- Offering instant updates on homework, attendance, and announcements
- Keeping parents informed and engaged using a simple mobile interface
