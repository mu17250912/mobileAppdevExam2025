## Project Overview

FarmerConnect is a Flutter-based Android mobile application that directly connects local farmers with buyers — such as individuals, restaurants, and stores — enabling them to sell crops and farm produce easily without involving middlemen. The app simplifies the selling process by providing real-time product listings, pricing, availability, and GPS-based delivery or pickup coordination.

## Problem Statement

Farmers often face difficulties selling their produce at fair prices due to reliance on intermediaries who reduce their profits. Buyers struggle to find reliable, fresh local produce. FarmerConnect bridges this gap by providing a direct, transparent platform that connects farmers and buyers, improving income for farmers and fresh access for buyers.

## Target Audience

- Local farmers seeking direct market access  
- Individual consumers looking for fresh farm produce  
- Restaurants and stores sourcing local agricultural products

## Key Features

- **Product Listing:** Farmers can create listings with details such as crop type, quantity, price, and availability.  
- **Pricing Transparency:** Buyers see clear prices set by farmers without markup from middlemen.  
- **Availability Tracking:** Real-time updates on product stock status to avoid disappointments.  
- **GPS-Based Delivery & Pickup Coordination:** The app uses location services to coordinate delivery routes or buyer pickup points efficiently.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up/sign-in for farmers and buyers to manage profiles and transactions.  
- **In-App Messaging:** Enables communication between farmers and buyers for negotiation and coordination.

## Monetization Strategy

- **Commission-based model:** FarmerConnect charges a small commission fee on successful transactions facilitated by the platform, incentivizing the app’s sustainability while keeping prices affordable for users.  
- Future plans include premium listings and promotional features for sellers.
