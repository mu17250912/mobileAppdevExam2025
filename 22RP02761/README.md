## 📱 App Name
**Blood Donor App**

## 🧩 Problem Statement
In Rwanda and many parts of the world, blood donation awareness and access are limited. People in urgent need of blood struggle to find suitable donors quickly. This app solves that problem by connecting **donors** and **collectors** (health officials or blood centers) in a real-time, mobile-friendly platform.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Individuals willing to donate blood.
- Health workers and hospitals looking for donors.
- Organizations planning blood drives.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented
- 🔐 Firebase Authentication (Email login & registration)
- 🩸 Donor Dashboard (Donate blood, view donation history)
- 🏥 Collector Dashboard (Manage donor list, send alerts)
- 🔄 Push Notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging
- 🎨 Clean and user-friendly UI (Responsive)
- 🌐 Firebase Hosting for web version (optional if web supported)

## 💰 Monetization Strategy
We use **Google AdMob Ads** integrated into the collector dashboard for revenue generation.
