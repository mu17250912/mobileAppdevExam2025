## App Description
EduMate is an offline study companion designed to help students review and test themselves without needing internet.

## Problem Statement
Many students, especially in areas with limited internet access, struggle to revise their notes effectively. Existing tools like Quizlet or Google Drive require a constant internet connection and are not optimized for offline environments. EduMate fills this gap by providing an offline, mobile-first solution for note revision, flashcards, and self-quizzing.

## Monetization Strategy
EduMate uses AdMob banner ads for monetization. Ads are shown on the dashboard and can be expanded to other screens. This approach is chosen because it allows the app to remain free for students, especially in regions where paid apps or in-app purchases are not feasible.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure sign up/sign in with Firebase Auth
- **Note to Flashcard Generator:** Convert notes into Q/A flashcards
- **Offline Quiz:** Quiz yourself using your flashcards, no internet required
- **Progress Tracker:** Track quizzes taken, correct answers, and study streaks
