# BetNova

I.	Idea Generation & Market Fit
1.	Real-World Problem 
Many people like to bet on football and other sports, but most betting apps do not show local matches or are hard to use. My app solves this by giving users in Rwanda and nearby countries an easy way to bet on local and international games using their phones.

2.	Target Audience.

My target audience is sports fans in Rwanda and nearby countries who use smartphones and want a simple, secure way to bet on football, basketball, and volleyball matches — especially local teams and leagues.

3. USP & Competitive Advantage.

Most betting apps are made for international users and ignore local teams. My app is different because it shows local matches, supports local leagues, and has an easy-to-use design for beginners. Only the admin can approve bets and set results, making it safer and more controlled.

4. Justification (How App Solves the Problem).

My app solves the problem by allowing users to easily bet on local and international matches through a simple mobile interface. It shows local teams, supports live matches, and lets users track their bets. Admin approval ensures fairness and security, which builds trust for local users.


II.	App Development & Implementation.

1.	Core Features
Here’s a clear and short answer based on My app BetNova:

A.	 User-Centric Design.
•	The app has a clean and simple design, making it easy for users to navigate.
•	It loads quickly on most Android phones.
•	I tested it on emulators and real devices to ensure it works well.
•	I used large buttons, clear icons, and readable fonts for better accessibility.

B.	Authentication & User Profiles
•	I used Firebase Authentication to let users sign up or log in with email and password.
•	Each user has a secure profile that shows their name, email, and betting history.
•	Only verified users can place bets.

C.	Key Functionality.
•	Users can view matches, select odds, and place bets.
•	Bets go to the admin for approval.
•	Admin can approve/reject bets, set match results, and manage teams and matches.
•	Users can see the status of each bet: Pending, Approved, Won, or Lost.

2. Income Generation Features.

•	I used Ad integration with Google AdMob to earn money from the app. Ads are shown on the home screen and match pages, so every time users open and use the app, I can generate revenue.
•	I chose this because it's simple to set up, doesn't require users to pay directly, and works well for apps with many active users.



3.	Payment Integration (Bonus).
I added a simulated MTN Mobile Money system. Users can enter an amount to deposit or withdraw, and the balance updates in Firestore.
A note shows: “This is a simulation – no real payment is made.

4.	Scalability & Performance.
I designed the app using clean code and modular widgets for easy updates and adding new features. I use lazy loading to load match and bet data only when needed, saving data and improving speed. The app works well on slow connections by minimizing data transfer and caching data locally.



III.  Monetization Strategy & Sustainability.

1.	Monetization Plan 

•	I use ad placement with Google AdMob to earn revenue. Ads appear on the home and match pages without interrupting users.
•	This choice fits my audience of sports fans who prefer a free app without mandatory payments. Ads allow me to earn while keeping the app easy and accessible.

2.	Analytics & Tracking.

I integrated Firebase Analytics to track user actions like sign-ups, bets placed, and app usage.
This helps me understand which features users like and how often they bet, so I can improve the app and increase revenue.

3. Sustainability Plan.

i. I will collect user feedback through in-app surveys and reviews to improve the app regularly.
ii. I plan to use referral programs to encourage users to invite friends, lowering customer acquisition costs.
iii. To keep users engaged, I use push notifications for match updates and results, plus a loyalty program to reward frequent bettors.




IV.	Security & Reliability.

1.	Security Measures 

•	I use Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-up and login. All user data is stored in Firestore with strict security rules that prevent unauthorized access.

•	I follow local data protection laws by only collecting necessary data and protecting user privacy. API calls are secured with proper permissions to avoid data leaks.

2.	Reliability.

I tested the app on different Android devices and screen sizes using emulators and real phones.
I used Flutter debug tools to fix bugs and ensure smooth performance.
I enabled Firebase Crashlytics to catch and report errors quickly, helping me fix issues before users notice



V.	Submission & Documentation.


1.	APK & AAB.

I submitted both the APK and AAB files in the correct format, ready for testing and Play Store deployment.

2.	Pull Request.

I created a clear pull request with my registration number 22RP02224 and a short summary of my project.

ii. App Name and Description.

App Name: BetNova
Description: A mobile betting app that lets users predict sports match outcomes (football, basketball, volleyball), place bets, and view results all controlled by one admin.

iii. Problem the App Solves.

Many sports fans lack access to local, secure, and easy-to-use betting platforms. BetNova fills this gap by supporting local teams and matches in a mobile-friendly way.
